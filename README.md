‚ö†Ô∏è Root access
To toggle Low Power Mode, Cooldown uses Terminal commands that require root access. That is why the app will ask you to authenticate with TouchID on every toggle. I'm looking into ways around this, so if you have any suggestions let me know @jordibruin. You can check out the source code for Cooldown on [Github](https://github.com/jordibruin/cooldown), if you want to compile it from source yourself.
